# Technical Specifications

*Note: This technical specification document contains placeholders for diagrams and certain technical details that will be refined as development progresses. Contributors interested in helping with these areas are encouraged to open an issue or discussion.*

## A.1. System Architecture Overview

### A.1.1. High-Level Architecture

The OmeoneChain platform consists of several interconnected components organized in a layered architecture:

1. **Base Layer**: IOTA Tangle implementation for transactions and metadata storage
2. **Storage Layer**: Hybrid on-chain/off-chain storage model with IPFS integration
3. **Protocol Layer**: Core logic for recommendations, token rewards, and reputation
4. **API Layer**: Interfaces for client applications and third-party integrations
5. **Application Layer**: Web and mobile interfaces, dApp ecosystem

![System Architecture Diagram] **[PLACEHOLDER: Architecture diagram showing component interactions]**

### A.1.2. IOTA Tangle Integration

OmeoneChain will leverage IOTA's Tangle as its foundational infrastructure due to its feeless transactions, parallel processing capabilities, and scalability advantages over traditional blockchains.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Network Type**: IOTA 1.5 Chrysalis (with planned migration path to IOTA 2.0/Coordicide)
- **Node Configuration**: Hornet nodes with permanode capabilities for historical data
- **Message Structure**: Custom message types for recommendations, votes, and reputation events
- **Tip Selection**: Modified algorithm optimized for recommendation data validation

**Transaction Flow:**

1. User actions (recommendations, votes, etc.) are submitted to network
2. Actions are validated by validating 2+ previous transactions in the Tangle
3. Metadata and verification hashes are stored directly on Tangle
4. Full content references are stored on IPFS with hashes recorded on Tangle
5. Token rewards are calculated and distributed based on action type and quality metrics

**[PLACEHOLDER: More specific details on IOTA libraries/frameworks to be used and custom message formats]**

### A.1.3. Modular Design Philosophy

To ensure adaptability and future-proofing, the architecture follows strict modularity principles:

1. **Blockchain Abstraction Layer**: Core platform logic is separated from the specific DAG implementation
2. **Storage Abstraction**: Content persistence mechanisms can be swapped or upgraded
3. **Pluggable Consensus**: Components can be modified as IOTA evolves from coordinator to fully decentralized consensus
4. **API Versioning**: All external interfaces follow semantic versioning to ensure backward compatibility
