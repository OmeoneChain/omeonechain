# OmeoneChain Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan and milestone targets for the OmeoneChain platform. Our roadmap is designed to provide transparency to contributors, users, and stakeholders about the project's direction and progress.

## Overview

OmeoneChain is being developed in four major phases, with each phase building upon the previous one to create a comprehensive, decentralized recommendation platform. This incremental approach allows us to validate core concepts, gather feedback, and adjust our direction as needed.

### Milestone 3.3: Security Audits and Optimizations (Q2 2026)
- Conduct comprehensive security audit
- Perform penetration testing
- Optimize transaction processing for scale
- Implement performance improvements
- Address all identified vulnerabilities

### Milestone 3.4: Public Testnet Launch (Q2 2026)
- Deploy to public testnet
- Launch beta program for early adopters
- Implement user feedback mechanisms
- Monitor system performance and stability
- Iterate based on user feedback and data

### Deliverables for Phase 3
- Complete API with documentation
- Mobile applications for iOS and Android

## Continuous Development

Beyond the initial phases, OmeoneChain will continue to evolve with:

- Regular protocol upgrades
- Expanded governance mechanisms
- Additional token utility features
- Enhanced AI and personalization capabilities
- New verticals and use cases

## Milestone Dependencies

The following key dependencies exist between milestones:

- IOTA integration (1.1) must be completed before data structure implementation (1.2)
- Storage architecture (1.3) is required for API development (1.4)
- Core protocol (Phase 1) must be stable before token reward system (2.1)
- Private testnet (2.4) must be successful before proceeding to API completion (3.1)
- Security audits (3.3) must be passed before public testnet (3.4)
- Public testnet (3.4) must demonstrate stability before mainnet (4.1)

## Adjustments and Updates

This roadmap will be reviewed quarterly and adjusted based on:

- Development progress
- Community feedback
- Technical challenges
- Market conditions
- Partnership opportunities

All updates to this roadmap will be communicated to the community through our official channels.
