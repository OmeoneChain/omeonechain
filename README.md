> A decentralized approach to transparent, incentivized recommendations

OmeoneChain is an open-source platform that leverages IOTA's Tangle technology to create a transparent and fair recommendation ecosystem. By combining DAG-based infrastructure with tokenized incentives, OmeoneChain addresses the fundamental problems of trust, transparency, and fair compensation that plague traditional recommendation platforms.

## üåü Project Overview

Traditional recommendation platforms suffer from fundamentally flawed incentive structures where businesses must pay for visibility and prominence, creating an inherently biased system. These "pay-to-play" models prioritize revenue over recommendation quality, while users creating valuable content receive no compensation for their contributions.

OmeoneChain solves these problems by:

- **Ensuring transparency** through immutable, DAG-based record-keeping
- **Rewarding contributions** with tokens for quality recommendations and curation
- **Removing pay-for-visibility** by implementing purely merit-based discovery
- **Creating fair monetization** through NFT-based experiences and direct value exchange
- **Enabling personalization** without compromising user privacy or platform integrity

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

OmeoneChain consists of several interconnected layers:

1. **Base Layer**: IOTA Tangle implementation for transactions and metadata
2. **Storage Layer**: Hybrid on-chain/off-chain storage with IPFS integration
3. **Protocol Layer**: Core logic for recommendations, token rewards, and reputation
4. **API Layer**: Interfaces for client applications and third-party integrations
5. **Application Layer**: Web and mobile interfaces, dApp ecosystem
