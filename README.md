> The Personal Recommendations Network. Powered by a Decentralized DAG

OmeoneChain is an open-source platform that leverages IOTA's Rebased technology to transform word-of-mouth recommendations into a verifiable, searchable social network. OmeoneChain is a social network for personal recommendations, not another review site. Built on a high‚Äëthroughput DAG ledger, it turns every recommendation from a friend, or a friend-of-a-friend, into a verifiable on-chain event. A Trust Score replaces the blunt five-star average, while a token-reward loop pays contributors in proportion to the real impact their advice has along the social graph.

## üåü Project Overview

OmeoneChain reimagines online recommendations by connecting trusted word-of-mouth directly to a social graph, making every recommendation verifiable and searchable on-chain. Unlike traditional review platforms plagued by paid placements and AI-generated content, OmeoneChain employs a Trust Score system based on your social connections, ensuring recommendations come from people you actually trust.

OmeoneChain's key features include:

- **Verifiable Social Graph**: Every recommendation is time-stamped on the IOTA Rebased DAG and ranked by personal Trust Score
- **Impact-First Rewards**: Contributors earn tokens (TOK) proportional to the actual impact their recommendations have within their social network  
- **No Pay-to-Play**: Rankings are determined by trust and quality, not advertising budgets
- **High-Performance DAG**: Near-instantaneous confirmations with micro-fees to enable real-time social interactions
- **Hybrid Storage**: On-chain metadata with off-chain content storage (IPFS/Arweave) for scalability
- **NFT Experiences**: Service providers can offer tokenized experiences and loyalty programs
- **Open dApp Ecosystem**: Developers can build specialized recommendation engines on top of the open API

### Token Economics

- Fixed supply: 10 billion TOK
- Distribution: 52% community rewards, 20% development, 16% ecosystem, 12% team
- Halving mechanism ensures long-term sustainability
- Multiple token sinks including service provider fees, NFT minting, and governance staking

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

OmeoneChain is organized in five distinct layers:

| Layer | Purpose | Key Technology |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Base** | Settlement & metadata | IOTA Rebased object-DAG (MoveVM) with Mysticeti DPoS & fee-burn mechanism |
| **Storage** | Persistent content | Hybrid on-chain/off-chain model: IPFS + optional Aleph.im pin-service |
| **Protocol** | Core business logic | Recommendations, token rewards, reputation, governance |
| **API/Adapter** | Chain abstraction | RebasedAdapter, EVMAdapter, MockAdapter |
| **Application** | End-user & dApp UX | Web, mobile, Move-script entry points, third-party dApps |

<!-- Note: This is a placeholder for future diagram -->

### Core Components

- **Recommendation Engine**: Processes submissions, handles search/retrieval, manages voting
- **Token Reward System**: Calculates and distributes rewards based on trust-weighted impact
- **Reputation System**: Assigns trust levels based on contribution quality and history
- **Hybrid Storage**: On-chain metadata with off-chain content storage

## üöÄ Getting Started
